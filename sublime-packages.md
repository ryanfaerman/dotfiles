I've never really found a good way to list the sublime packages I use so I just list them here:

 - AdvancedNewFile
 - GoSublime (see gosublime section)
 - Theme - Spacegrey
 - Coffeescript
 - Markdown Preview
 - Sass


## GoSublime
GoSublime is awesome but it needs a little help to be even better. Install goimports. Directions are here: http://michaelwhatcott.com/gosublime-goimports/
